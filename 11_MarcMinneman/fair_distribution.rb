RPCFN Challenge #6:: Fair Distribution
Author:: Marc Minneman

Complete Greedy Algorithm [Korf, 1998]

Optimal solution is discovered using a k-ary search tree that implements a greedy heuristic.

Jobs are sorted in order, and each job in turn is placed in each of k different subsets,
generating a k-ary tree. The leftmost branch places the next number in the subset with the
smallest sum so far, the next branch places it in the next larger subset, etc. Thus, the first
solution found is the greedy solution. By never placing a number in more than one empty subset,
we avoid generating duplicate partitions that differ only by a permutation of the subsets, and
produce all O(kn/k!) distinct k-way partitions of n elements. More generally, by never placing
a number in two different subsets with the same subset sum, we avoid generating different
partitions that have the same partition difference.

Finally, a perfect partition will have a difference of zero if the sum of the original jobs
is divisible by k, and a difference of one otherwise. Once a perfect partition is found, the
algorithm is terminated.
