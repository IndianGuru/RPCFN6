Imagine that you manage a t-shirt printing company.  Each morning you review 
all orders placed the prior day and determine how long each order will take to 
fulfill.  On any given day, only a certain number of your printing machines
are operational.  Your job is to schedule each printing job with one of the 
operational printing machines in such a manner that (a) all t-shirts are 
printed in the least amount of time, and (b) that the distribution of work
across machines is as fair as possible (i.e. the standard deviation of the
time each machine spends working is minimized).

Your objective is to write a FairDistribution class that satisfies the 
following test cases.  The code in the test cases is sufficient to define the 
methods you must implement.
